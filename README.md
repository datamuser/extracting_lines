# extracting_lines
Extract lines matching patterns from a very large file

Matches patterns in file 1 with lines in file 2, then outputs the lines containing the words in file 1 to the output file. Similar to UNIX command (but when both file 1 and file 2 are large - which creates a memory problem): grep -f keep_file input_file > output_file

At data muse, we can help you solve memory issues as well as speed up your analysis pipelines. See datamuse.co.uk for details
